- The questions that were created on a specific topic and reasoning behind the need to obtain data.

I am collecting information/answers for an interview at SalesForce. I am asking the user/interviewee how they work with others, personal qualities, problem solving and knowledge on computer science/coding as SalesForce is a IT company. We need to reviece this data from the interviewee because it is important to know how the person will react and respond based on a job when problems can come up anytime and you need to work with others and not get frusterated.
